# PvCustomizer - What and Why

## What

This utility lets you customize the Project Window in two ways:
1. Draw custom icons for folders based on path/name/extension/regex matching.
2. Draw custom icons for Scriptable Object assets, adding flavor and ease-of-use to your project.

## Why

The creator of the repository holds the view that customization of the project browser/window in Unity is such a fundamental QoL improvement that it shouldn't be locked behind assets that cost 15-20$ each. He does not claim that the effort put behind such assets by their creators isn't reward-worthy. If you can afford these assets and think the professional support to be a plus, I highly recommend purchasing them to support their ongoing development.

## Please Note

This utility is still in very early stages of development. The core is there, and it works -- on the surface.
Please report any bugs you find to harsh@aka.al or create a new issue.
